### Introduction of Files:

0---2 conv layers

1---3 conv layers

2---4 conv layers

3---1 res block

4---2 res blocks

5---1 senet block

6---2 senet blocks

These ids are corresponding to matrices displayed under the folder of 'Matrix' and specific architectures of models under the folder of 'Model'. I also listed names of true classes and their top 4 proportion of wrong categories under the folder of 'Results'. You can check the names of 100 categories in the 'Class_names'.

### Implementation:

- You can download and click the 'Code.html' to see the detailed implementation.
- Load those matrices use numpy.loadtxt(filename).

### Limitations:

Models are easy to overfit and accuracy of those models are low.
